- Niche: The native range of the Indian peafowl encompasses India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal. However, because it was introduced in other places, it now also lives in Australia, USA, New Zealand, and the Bahamas. The Indian Peafowl feeds on plants, berries, seeds, and insects, along with other organisms. They maintain the populations of these small insects and even some reptiles, such as snakes and lizards. Its predators include mongooses, jungle cats, stray dogs, leopards, and tigers. They can be beneficial for crops because they eat small insects that eat crops, such as grasshoppers. However, they can be harmful to gardens because they damage the plants. In some parts of the world, they are poached by hunters for their feathers and meat.
