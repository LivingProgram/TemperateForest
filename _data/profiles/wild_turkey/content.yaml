other :
  - Regulator: It is a warm-blooded creature and can maintain relatively constant internal conditions (such as homeostasis)
  - Dormancy: Turkeys do not migrate long distances. Their diets change during the winter and they will continue to roam around for food.
  - Generalist: They can survive off a variety of different prey and can live in different habitats because of the way they are built
  - Consumer: They are unable to make their own food and rely on their environment for food and nutrients
  - Omnivore: Its diet consists of plants and animals
  - Niche: Turkeys can fly quickly, but they cannot soar high in the sky like eagles. They can also run very quickly, especially when they need to escape from their predators, such as foxes, owls, and hawks. Many other predators including raccoons, opossums, striped skunks, birds, and woodchucks, will prey on turkey eggs. Turkeys prey on insects, spiders, snails, slugs, salamanders, and small lizards. They are diurnal animals, and do not migrate. They usually live in woodlands and forests with lots of clearings in meadows. Many live throughout Mexico, and also in the U.S.
