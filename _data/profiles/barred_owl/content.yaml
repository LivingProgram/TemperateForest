  - Niche: Barred Owls are found in North America on the east side of the U.S, throughout Canada, and in small areas in Mexico. The Great Horned Owl is one of the biggest threats to the Barred Owl, and the Barred Owl will move away if there is a Great Horned Owl nearby. Barred Owls eat many small animals, such as mice. Rodents usually cause problems for many people, so the Barred Owl is helpful in solving this problem. They're nocturnal animals, which means they sleep during the day and are active and hunting in the night. Predators include eagles, large hawks, and other owls.
