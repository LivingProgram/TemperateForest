Habitat: this is the specific environment it live in, and includes the biotic and abiotic factors present in its surroundings
Organism: this level is where researchers may examine how one kind of organism meets the challenges and opportunities of its environment through its physiology or behavior
Population: a group of individuals of the same species living in particular geographic area
Community: this is the third level that includes the assemblage of all the populations of organisms living close enough together for potential interaction, including the biotic factors in the environment
Ecosystem: this is the fourth level of ecological study that includes both the biotic and the abiotic components of the environment
Landscapes: scientists take a wider perspective by studying these, which are arrays of ecosystems
Biosphere: this extends from the atmosphere several kilometers above Earth to the depths of the oceans, and is all of Earth that is inhabited by life
Benthic realm: the substrate, or seafloor of the ocean
Pelagic realm: this includes all open water and the substrate, which is also known as the benthic realm
Photic zone: this zone is marked by the depth of light penetration (200 m)
Continental shelves: the photic zone includes both the pelagic and benthic realms, In shallow areas such as the submerged parts of continents
Phytoplankton: (microscopic algae and cyanobacteria) and multicellular algae that provides energy and organic carbon for a diverse community of animals by photosynthesis in sunlit regions.
Zooplankton: (small, drifting animals), fish, mammals, and many other types of animals are abundant in the pelagic photic zone.
Aphotic zone: The zone Below the photic zone of the ocean
Intertidal: the zone where the ocean meets land, the shore is pounded by waves during high tide and exposed to the sun and drying winds during low tide.
Estuary: a biome that occurs where a freshwater stream or river merges with the ocean.
Wetlands: a biome that is transitional between an aquatic ecosystem- either marine or freshwater- and a terrestrial one.
Tropical Forests: A terrestrial biome characterized by high levels of precipitation and warm temperatures year round.
Savanna: A biome dominated by grasses and scattered trees.
Desert: A biome characterized by organisms adapted to sparse rainfall (less than 30 cm per year) and rapid evaporation.
Desertification: The conversion of semi-arid regions to desert. 
Chaparral: A biome dominated by spiny evergreen shrubs adapted to periodic droughts and fires; found where cold ocean currents circulate offshore, creating mild, rainy winters and long, hot, dry summers.
Temperate Grassland: A grassland region maintained by seasonal drought, occasional fires, and grazing by large animals.
Temperate Broadleaf Forest: A biome located throughout mid latitude regions, where there is sufficient moisture to support the growth of large, broadleaf deciduous trees.
Coniferous Forest: A biome characterized by conifer, cone-bearing evergreen trees.
Taiga: The northern coniferous forests, characterized by long, snowy winters and short, wet summers, extending across North America and Eurasia to the southern border of the arctic tundra; also found just below alpine tundra on mountainsides in temperate zones.
Temperate Rain Forest: Coniferous forests of coastal North America (from Alaska to Oregon) supported by warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean. 
Tundra: A biome at the northernmost limits of plant growth and at high altitudes, characterized by dwarf, woody shrubs, grasses, mosses, and lichens.
Permafrost: Continuously frozen ground found in the arctic tundra.
Polar Ice: A terrestrial biome that includes regions of extremely low temperature and low precipitation located at high latitudes north of the arctic tundra and in Antarctica.  
Community: An assemblage of all populations of organisms living close enough together for potential interaction.
Interspecific interactions: Relationships with individuals of other species in the community- that greatly affect populations structure and dynamics.
Mutualism: When both populations benefit.
Herbivory: Consumption of plant parts or algae by an animal.
Ecological niche: The sum of its use of the biotic and biotic resources in its environment.
Trophic structure: A pattern of feeding relationships consisting of several different levels.
Food chain: The sequence of food transfer up the trophic levels
Producers: The trophic level that supports all others consists of autotrophs, starting at the bottom
Primary consumers: Herbivores which eat plants, algae, or phytoplankton
Secondary consumers: Small mammals, such as the mouse shown here eating an herbivorous insect, and a great variety of birds, frogs, and spiders, as well as lions and other large carnivores that eat grazers.
Tertiary consumers: Higher trophic levels, such as the snakes that eat mice and other secondary consumers.
Detritus: The dead material produced at all the trophic levels.
Scavengers: Which are large animals, such as crows and vultures , feast in carcasses left behind by predators or speeding cars.
Detritivores: Their diet is made up primarily of decaying organic material.
Decomposers: Mainly prokaryotes and fungi secrete enzymes that digest molecules in organic material and convert them to inorganic forms.
Decomposition: The breakdown of organic materials to inorganic ones
Food web: A network of interconnecting food chains.
Species diversity: Defined by two components, species richness, or the number of different species in a community, and relative abundance, the proportional representation of each species in a community.
Disturbances: Events such as storms, fires, floods, droughts, as human activities that damage Biological communities and alter the availability of resources.
Ecological succession:  Process of biological community change resulting from disturbance
Primary succession: When ecological succession begins in a virtually lifeless area with no soil
Secondary succession: Occurs when a disturbance has cleared away an existing community but left the soil intact.
Invasive species: Species that spread far beyond the original point of introduction and causing environmental or economic damage by colonizing and dominating wherever they find a suitable habitat.
Biological control: The intentional release of a natural enemy to attack a pest population.
Ecosystem: All the organisms in a given area, along with the nonliving (abiotic) factors with which they interact; a biological community and its physical environment.
